Where we sail off the edge.

16.1 Magnitude

We have come all this way without a theorem, I now eliminate the deficiency.

Theorem 1 An S object with at least one attribute consumes an infinite amount of space.

Proof: The demonstration uses the in-built matrix freeny.x, but the particular object — as long as it has an attribute — is immaterial. Consider the sequence:

> attributes(attributes(freeny.x))
$names:
[1] "dim"      "dimnames"
> attributes(attributes(attributes(freeny.x)))
$names:
[1] "names"
> attributes(attributes(attributes(
+         attributes(freeny.x))))
$names:
[1] "names"

Obviously this continues ad infinitum so the size of the object is bounded below by:

> object.size(attributes(attributes(attributes(
+         freeny.x)))) * Inf
[1] Inf

Q.E.D. ♠

16.2 Dostoevsky

Twice-two-makes-four is a farcical, dressed-up fellow who stands across your path with arms akimbo and spits at you. Mind you, I quite agree that twice-two-makes-four is a most excellent thing; but if we are to give everything its due, then twice-two-makes-five is sometimes a most charming little thing, too.

Fyodor Dostoevsky Notes from the Underground translated by David Magarshack

The object of the game is to make twice two equal five.

My first method is rather cheap and unsatisfactory. It gives the required answer:

>2*2 [1] 5

but is clumsy elsewhere.

> 2 * 0:9
[1] 1 3 5 7 91113151719

Here’s the adjustment:

> get("*")
function(e1, e2)
.Internal(e1 * e2, "do_op", T, 4) + 1

The next attempt is slightly better, though it goes to the bother of writing a new function.

> twice(2)
[1] 5
> twice(1:9)
[1] 2 5 6 81012141618

Behind the scenes is a little work involving two’s and five’s:

"twice" <- function(x)
{
        2 * x + dnorm(x - 2, sd = 1/sqrt(2 * pi)/5)/5
}

This definition of twice gives answers close to the usual except for inputs close to 2.

16.3 Things to Do

Make 2 ∗ 2 = 5.

Develop a topology for S objects.
